# LangGraph CampusX AI Projects

Welcome to the **LangGraph CampusX AI Projects** repository!  
This repo contains hands-on projects, experiments, and code samples for building advanced AI workflows using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and related LLM technologies.  
It is designed for learners and developers interested in exploring LLMs, prompt chaining, agent workflows, and practical graph-based AI applications.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **fundamental/**:
  - `0_test_installation.ipynb`: Quick test to verify LangGraph installation and environment setup.
  - `1_bmi_workflow.ipynb`: Example workflow for calculating BMI using LangGraph nodes and edges.
  - `2_simple_llm_workflow.ipynb`: Demonstrates a basic LLM workflow using LangGraph.
  - `3_prompt_chaining_workflow.ipynb`: Shows how to chain prompts and process outputs in a graph structure.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Graph-Based Workflows**: Build and visualize AI workflows as directed graphs.
- **Prompt Chaining**: Connect multiple prompt steps for complex reasoning.
- **LLM Integration**: Use OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and more in graph nodes.
- **Agent Workflows**: Implement agent-based reasoning and tool use.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend and modify workflows for experimentation.
