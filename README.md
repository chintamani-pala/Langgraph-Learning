# LangGraph CampusX AI Projects

Welcome to the **LangGraph CampusX AI Projects** repository!  
This repo contains hands-on projects, experiments, and code samples for building advanced AI workflows using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and related LLM technologies.  
It is designed for learners and developers interested in exploring LLMs, prompt chaining, agent workflows, and practical graph-based AI applications.

## üìñ Example Projects

### Test Installation

- Run [`fundamental/0_test_installation.ipynb`](fundamental/0_test_installation.ipynb) to verify your environment and LangGraph setup.

### BMI Workflow

- [`fundamental/1_bmi_workflow.ipynb`](fundamental/1_bmi_workflow.ipynb) demonstrates a simple graph workflow for BMI calculation.

### Simple LLM Workflow

- [`fundamental/2_simple_llm_workflow.ipynb`](fundamental/2_simple_llm_workflow.ipynb) shows how to use LangGraph for basic LLM tasks.

### Prompt Chaining Workflow

- [`fundamental/3_prompt_chaining_workflow.ipynb`](fundamental/3_prompt_chaining_workflow.ipynb) illustrates chaining prompts and processing outputs in a graph.

### Batsman Parallel Workflow

- [`fundamental/4_batsman_parallel_workflow.ipynb`](fundamental/4_batsman_parallel_workflow.ipynb) demonstrates parallel computation in LangGraph by calculating multiple cricket statistics (strike rate, balls per boundary, boundary percentage) in parallel nodes and summarizing the results. Shows how to use partial state updates for parallel workflows.

### Parallel LLM Workflow

- [`fundamental/5_parallel_llm_workflow.ipynb`](fundamental/5_parallel_llm_workflow.ipynb) showcases a parallel evaluation of an essays using Google Gemini. Multiple aspects (language, analysis, clarity) are evaluated in parallel nodes, and results are aggregated and summarized. Demonstrates structured output and advanced graph design for LLM-based feedback.

### Quadratic Equation Conditional Workflow

- [`fundamental/6_quadratic_equation_conditional_workflow.ipynb`](fundamental/6_quadratic_equation_conditional_workflow.ipynb) evaluates a quadratic equation using conditional logic in LangGraph. Based on the discriminant, the graph follows different paths to output either real or imaginary root handling. Demonstrates use of branching and formatting in a mathematical context.

### Review Reply Conditional Workflow

- [`fundamental/7_review_reply_conditional_workflow.ipynb`](fundamental/7_review_reply_conditional_workflow.ipynb) processes product reviews and uses LLM sentiment classification to conditionally generate responses. Positive and negative reviews are handled with different node paths. Great example of combining logic and LLM outputs for automated customer support or feedback systems.
